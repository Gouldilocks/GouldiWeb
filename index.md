## Projects

### Java Grading Program
[Github Link](https://github.com/Gouldilocks/Java-Grading-Script)
```
- Developed in Shell and Python
- Connects to Canvas using the Canvas API
- Downloads all the submissions of students given in a text file
- Fixes the directories fo the students who do not follow normal submission guidelines
- Compiles all java projects students submit
- Runs all java projects using Expect scripts which send inputs to the program
- Saves the outputs of all the programs that are run
- Posts comments and grades using the Canvas API
```

### Data Structures Grading Program
[Github Link](https://github.com/Gouldilocks/DataStructuresScripting)
```
- Developed in Shell and Python
- Clones all github repositories of students to be graded
- Runs all cmake projects the students made with text file arguments
- Runs valgrind on each cmake project
- Scans the valgrind output file for lost blocks and presents it to the user
- Posts grades and comments on canvas
```

### Sentiment Analysis

```
-Used a custom wrapper for c-strings for all data input, with char arrays only being used when inputting from a file.
-Dataset consisted of 50,000 pre-sorted movie reviews.
-In the project, the first 40,000 reviews were used in order to create a classifier from a lexiconical approach.
-The final 10,000 reviews were tested using the classifier and produced 51% accuracy.
```

### Auto-Indexer

```
-Used custom vector and linked-list classes for the project.
-An input file was given, which listed words and subcategories.
-Each of the words were printed in the output file with its corresponding page numbers.
```

### Algorithm Analysis

```
-Program analysed the number of comparisons made by 6 different sorting algorithms: 
  Gnome sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, selection sort, and bubble sort.
-A total of 30 data sets were used, with 10 varying sizes, and 3 arrangements:
  in-order, reverse order, and randomized order.
  ```
  
### Flight Planner

 ```
 -Program did an exhaustive search using iterative backtracking for constraing optimization.
 -Custom stack adapter class as well as adjacency list wrapper class was made from scratch.
 -input was a list of possible flights, their time to take the flight, cost, as well as the airline.
 -other input file consisted of a list of requested flights, and the optimization factor, wich was either cost or time.
 -The iterative backtracking algorithm used a stack in order to keep track of where in the list it was.
 -The output file consisted of the top three flight combinations to achieve the requested flights.

## Relevant Work Experience
```
1. Fall 2020, Spring 2021, Fall 2021: TA for KNW 2300
	-Worked with students based upon an Agile workflow
	-Debug Arduino C code
	-Debug electrical wiring
	
2. Spring 2021, Fall 2021: TA for Data Structures
	-Work with students to debug C++ code
	-Assist students in creating custom data structures including: string, vector, linkedlist, hashmap, adjacency list
	
3. Summer 2021: Internship at McKesson
	-Worked with a team of 6 software engineers, and 1 project manager
	-Workflow was an AGILE setup
	-Created from scratch in Java the McKesson Diagnostics Library for use by all of the Automation and Mobility department
		-This library was to be a debug library for use in finding bugs in code. Its main function was to print out the
		call stack in order to help engineers better debug their code.
		-Written using CDI, in order to allow for easy expandability of the library.
```
## Hobbies and Interests
```
-I love reading about and driving old American cars, I can in fact name off all 22 trim levels of the Dodge challenger.
-I like to work on calligraphy whenever I get the chance, at home I love to practice with my various dip pens.
-Working out and lifting weights is a passion of mine, I am working towards my personal trainer's certification.
