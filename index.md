## Projects

### Sentiment Analysis
```
-Used a custom wrapper for c-strings for all data input, with char arrays only being used when inputting from a file.
-Dataset consisted of 50,000 pre-sorted movie reviews.
-In the project, the first 40,000 reviews were used in order to create a classifier from a lexiconical approach.
-The final 10,000 reviews were tested using the classifier and produced 51% accuracy.
```

### Auto-Indexer
```
-Used custom vector and linked-list classes for the project.
-An input file was given, which listed words and subcategories.
-Each of the words were printed in the output file with its corresponding page numbers.
```

### Algorithm Analysis
```
-Program analysed the number of comparisons made by 6 different sorting algorithms: 
  Gnome sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, selection sort, and bubble sort.
-A total of 30 data sets were used, with 10 varying sizes, and 3 arrangements:
  in-order, reverse order, and randomized order.
  ```
  
 ### Flight Planner
 ```
 -Program did an exhaustive search using iterative backtracking for constraing optimization.
 -Custom stack adapter class as well as adjacency list wrapper class was made from scratch.
 -input was a list of possible flights, their time to take the flight, cost, as well as the airline.
 -other input file consisted of a list of requested flights, and the optimization factor, wich was either cost or time.
 -The iterative backtracking algorithm used a stack in order to keep track of where in the list it was.
 -The output file consisted of the top three flight combinations to achieve the requested flights.

## Hobbies and Interests
```
-I love reading about and driving old American cars, I can in fact name off all 22 trim levels of the Dodge challenger.
-I like to work on calligraphy whenever I get the chance, at home I love to practice with my various dip pens.
